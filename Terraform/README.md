I have create 2 separate Terraform Directories here.  Primarily because the end-result is not *absolutely* depdendent on both being deployed. 

Bastion_and_Egress - deploys the resources needed for a Bastion host, as well as egress network traffic (for Quay).
OpenShift_Cluster - deploys the requisite resources for a Private Cluster install on AWS
